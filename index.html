				Q: Where will schools of the future be located?<br>
				A: In the cloud, itâ€™s not that the current education system is flawed. But the system we have now is based on examinations and punishment which prevents the student from enjoying the process of learning.
			</li>
			<li>
				Q: Who will the teachers be?<br>
				A: The lectures of today is very general and doesnâ€™t help the students with their individual problems. In the future we need teachers that can diagnose whatâ€™s wrong with the students and based on that knowledge make the lessons as productive as possible.

		<div>Computers are a big part of today’s education, but what effects does it have on the environment?
		Computers have a lot of environmentally harmful parts. A few examples are; lead, which damages a lot
		of plants and animals, but also the human being. Mercury, which can spread in the water and damage animals,
		especially fishes. Plastic, that can be found in all cables and on the computer case.
		Plastic contains a lot of dangerous substances and when you burn down the computer parts, the substances
		can leak as gases and is especially harmful for aquatic animals. The substances causes birth defects and
		cancer. A bigger production of computers causes more damage to the environment. 
		We already have environmentally friendly computers</div>
