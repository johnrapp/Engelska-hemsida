	Today technology is a massive part of our everyday life. Just look around 
	when you're on the bus, you'll defenitely see the majority of the people 
	staring down on their phones or tablets. Because of this, people are going 
	to have a greater knowledge about technology and we'll be able to take 
	advantage of that in many different ways. One of the biggest positives 
	about this is that it can be used in education.
