			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			
			<p>Todays technology is a massive part of our everyday life. Just look around when you're on the bus and you'll definitely see the majority of the people staring down at their phones or tablets.Because of this, people are going to have a greater knowledge about technology and we'll be able to take advantage of that in many different ways. One of the biggest benefits about the progress of technology is that we're going to be able to take advantage of that within education and the school in the future.This site is about the good possibilities and possible dangerous consequences of future technology in education and schools</p>

			<h1>Environment</h1>
			<section>
				<p>Computers are a big part of today’s education but what effects does it have on the environment? A lot of the components in computers are harmful to the environment. A few examples are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Lead, which damages a lot of plants and animals, including humans.</li>
					<li>Mercury, which can spread in the water and damage animals, especially fishes.</li>
					<li>Plastic, which can be found in all cables and on the computer case. Plastic contains a lot of dangerous substances and when you burn computer parts the substances can leak as gases and is especially harmful for aquatic animals. The substances causes birth defects and cancer. A bigger production of computers causes more damage to the environment.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Because of the large usage of computers, recycling has been more and more important. Nowadays, almost every recycling center has at least section for electronics, where you can throw away your computer if you don’t want it anymore.</p>
				<p>The most environmentally friendly computers are the laptops. The computers of today last much longer than the old ones. Because of laptops being energy saving, ther’s been a huge positive difference for the environment in the past ten years. A new thing that is even friendlier to the enviroment than computers is
				<span class="term" data-explination="A Smart Board is a display that’s connected to a computer, a projector projects the computers screen on the Smart Board, (usually on a wall) you use the board with a pen, your fingers, a stylus or any other device. They can be used for all kind of stuff."> Smart Boards</span>
				. Smart Boards takes less space, is more environmentally friendly, is a lot easier for the teachers to use and a lot more fun fpr the students to use. A few schools use it today and hopefully all schools will use it in the future.</p>

			<h1>In depth</h1>
			<p>Computers, tablets, phones, gaming devices, e-books etc. I could go on all day. The amount of different technological devices that we use in our everyday life is crazy, they’ve become more and more common and we’re constantly developing new products. The pace of which these products are evolving are mind blowing and who knows where we’ll be in 20-30 years. It’s impossible to say how far we’ve come technological wise in 20 years but something that’s certain is that we’ll be able to take advantage of the progress. One of the biggest aspects of this is the schools and education, today there’s already a lot of things that’s being utilized in the schools. Buying computers to the students is something that’s become very normal, a lot of schools are doing it and I think that’s great. It’s not cheap but computers are very effective when it comes to schoolwork and they’re a great tool. Hopefully in the future, students that are home and sick can do some work from home and maybe even do tests from home, there should also be good tools for teachers. This would make everything so much easier and things could run much more smoothly. Not taking advantage of the benefits and perks from this would be incredibly stupid since this is something that would improve efficiency and be something that would improve us as a country.</p>

			<p>Just like with everything that we like there are bad aspects of it. When working with computers all day it’s important to think about your workstation. Have a good chair and try to sit “normal”. It’s easy to get back and neck pain due to musculoskeletal problems. Taking small breaks, like walking to the toilet or just standing up and walking around is something that could help. The most common problems when working with computers consistently except ergonomics are Carpal tunnel syndrome and Computer vision syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is stress-related and is caused by repetitive movements, often the wrist. It leads to musculoskeletal problems and pain. Computer vision syndrome is something that can reduce eyesight, tiredness in the eyes or blurred vision.</p>
			<p>All of these are serious problems if you get affected by them but all of them can be avoided thanks to our improved knowledge and experience in the subject.</p>

			<h1>History</h1>
			<p>The first electronic computer was made 1938. The man behind the creation of Z1 was Konrad Zuse. The computer was built in his parents’ living room and Zuse financed the computer himself. The computer itself wasn’t too much different from the computers today in the sense that it had almost all parts of a modern computer. It had memory,
			<span class="term" data-explination="IO is an abbreviation for input-output."> IO </span>
			devices, floating-point logic, micro sequences and a control unit. However the computers of today have more components and are more complicated. Zuse built Z2, Z3 and Z4 later on. This were the beginning of the computers, they’ve improved more and more throughout the years and became more and more common. Today we all know about computers. You can pretty much use them for anything, like gaming, studying, shopping or maybe interact with other people in social media. The transformation have been immense.</p>

			<p>Hopefully we’ll be able to take advantage of the possibilities this is going to give us in the future. You can already see Smart Boards and computers being used as a tool in various schools. Some schools even use tablets in their educational process. Since the society have always reflected the quality of education at schools, schools have been the subject of many, many debates through the history. An example of this is that during the 20th century, availability of education where something that could turn a poor country into a country with a blooming industry. The access to all the luxuries we have today is something that we should take advantage of and use as a platform to reach even further as a country. If you look at history, you can see that it really pays off. We should use history not only to avoid making the same mistakes as in the past, but also to learn from what we did right.</p>
