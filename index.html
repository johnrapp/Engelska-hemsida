		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				Q: Where will schools of the future be located?<br>
				A: In the cloud, it's not that the current education system is flawed. But the system we have now is based on examinations and punishment which prevents the student from enjoying the process of learning.
			</li>
			<li>
				Q: Who will the teachers be?<br>
				A: The lectures of today is very general and doesn't help the students with their individual problems. In the future we need teachers that can diagnose what's wrong with the students and based on that knowledge make the lessons as productive as possible.'

		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		
		<p>Today technology is a massive part of our everyday life.
		Just look around when you're on the bus, you'll definitely see
		the majority of the people staring down on their phones or tablets. 
		Because of this, people are going to have a greater knowledge about 
		technology and we'll be able to take advantage of that in many different ways. 
		One of the biggest positives about the progress of technology is that we're going to 
		be able to take advantage of that within education and the school in general in the future. 
		This site is about the good possibilities and possible dangerous consequences of future technology.</p>

		<h1>History</h1>
		<p>The first electronic computer was made 1938, the man behind the creation of Z1 was Konrad Zuse. 
		The computer was built in his parents' living room and Zuse financed the computer himself. The computer 
		itself wasn't too much different from the computers today in the sense that it had almost all parts of a 
		modern computer. It had memory, input-output devices, floating-point logic, micro sequences and control unit. 
		But todays computers do of course have a lot more stuff and are more complicated. Zuse built Z2, Z3 and Z4 later on. 
		This were the beginning of the computers, they've improved more and more throughout the years and become 
		more and more common. Today we all know about computers. You can pretty much use them for anything, 
		like gaming, studying, shopping or maybe interact with other people in social media. The transformation have been immense.
		Hopefully we'll be able to take advantage of the possibilities this is going to give us in the future. 
		You can already today see Smart Boards* and computers being used in school as a tool for education. 
		Some schools even use tablets in their educational process. The society have always been reflected 
		of how the school have been, and that's probably why education and the schools generally have been the subject of 
		many, many debates through the history, that's why it's so interesting to people! An example of this is that during the 
		twentieth century, availability of education, where something that could turn a poor country into a blooming industry. 
		So the access to all these luxuries we have today is something that we should take advantage of and use as a platform to reach 
		even further as a country. Because if you look at history, that really should pay off. We should use history not only to avoid 
		making the same mistakes as in the past, but also to learn from what we did right.</p>

		<p>* A Smart Board is a display that's connected to a computer, a projector projects the computers screen on the Smart Board, (usually on a wall) you use the board with a pen, your fingers, a stylus or any other device. They can be used for all kind of stuff.</p>

		<h1>Environment</h1>
		<p>Computers are a big part of today's education, but what effects does it have on the environment?</p>
		
		<p>Computers have a lot of environmentally harmful parts. A few examples are; lead, which damages a lot of plants and animals, but also the human being. Mercury, which can spread in the water and damage animals, especially fishes. Plastic, that can be found in all cables and on the computer case. Plastic contains a lot of dangerous substances and when you burn down the computer parts, the substances can leak as gases and is especially harmful for aquatic animals. The substances causes birth defects and cancer. A bigger production of computers causes more damage to the environment.</p>

<<<<<<< HEAD
			<p>We already have environmentally friendly computers but a new thing that is friendlier than computers, is SMART Boards. It's like a computer but it; takes less space, is more environmentally friendly, it's a lot easier for the teachers to teach and a lot funnier for the students to learn. A few schools have already tried it, and hopefully all schools will use it in the future.'</p>
