	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	
	Today technology is a massive part of our everyday life.
	 Just look around when you're on the bus, you'll definitely see
	  the majority of the people staring down on their phones or tablets. 
	  Because of this, people are going to have a greater knowledge about 
	  technology and we'll be able to take advantage of that in many different ways. 
	  One of the biggest positives about the progress of technology is that we’re going to 
	  be able to take advantage of that within education and the school in general in the future. 
	  This site is about the good possibilities and possible dangerous consequences of future technology. </div>
